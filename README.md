# hello-world
Just one more repository
This is the intro project I am following along in order to better acquaint myself with this platform called github.  
I'm hoping it will be the beginning of a long and fruitful journey into the world of programming and development!
I'm excited to see where this leads, and to learn all the valuable skills there are to learn in the world of computers.
